## Usage

```
Usage: gocommit [options]
  -dry-run
    	Show a message example
  -help
    	Show available flags
  -no-prefix
    	Disable the prefix in the commit message. [branch] by default
  -prefix string
    	Define a custom prefix for the commit message
  -version
    	Show the version of the application
```


1. **Stage Your Changes**:
   - Use `git add` to stage your changes:
     ```bash
     git add -A
     ```

2. **Run GoCommit**:
   - Invoke the tool to automatically generate and create a commit:
     ```bash
     gocommit
     ```
3. **puah Your Changes**:
   -  Use  `git push` to push your changes:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

## Rules

- Ensure you have a branch checked out before running `gocommit`. If you don't have a branch, create one using:
  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>
  git checkout <branch-name>

- Reminder: Dry-run mode is not deterministic. The message is coming from Ollama with LLM.   

## Work in progress

BUGS to fix:

- [ ] The fucking `git diff --cached` is  not implemented using the `go-git` library. Currently is a shitty exec.

## Building from Source

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  cd your-repo
  go build -o gocommit ./cmd/gocommit
  sudo mv gocommit /usr/local/bin/ 
  ```
